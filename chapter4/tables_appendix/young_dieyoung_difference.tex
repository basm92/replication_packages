\item \textit{Note: } 
\item The table shows RD estimates using the MSE-optimal bandwidth \citep{cattaneo2019practical}. The Dependent Variable is Log(1+Personal Wealth). I report bias-corrected standard errors clustered at the individual level. The first two columns show estimates of the returns for individuals with a below and above-median lifespan after election, the second two estimates the results for individuals with a lifespan after election below and above the 40th quantile, and the third pair shows the results for individuals with a lifespan after election below and above the 30th quantile. Columns (1), (3) and (5) contain estimates with covariates including district characteristics, number of tries, number of votes, nd number of candidates. Columns (2), (4) and (6) control for number of tries, party, and district population. *: p < 0.1, **: p < 0.05, ***: p < 0.01.
