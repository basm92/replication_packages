## Replication Package for Chapter 3: "Democratization, Personal Wealth of Politicians and Voting Behavior"

- What is in this replication package?
  - The Code used to create the Figures (output in folder `/figures/`) and Tables (output in folder `/tables/`) in the text
    - The Code contains several files. Below is a description: 
      - Code files starting with `Tab` and `Fig` contain the Code used to create the correspondingly numbered Table or Graph in the text. 
      - The Code for the Figures is in the folder `/chapter3/code/code_for_figures/`. 
      - `code/analysis/results/new_descr_stats.R` contains the code for Tables 3.2 and 3.3. This is also indicated by the notes inside the R-file. 
      - `code/analysis/results/new_results.R` contains the code for most of the tables starting from the data. Inside the file, I have indicate the number of the corresponding table in the text. 
      - Various robustness checks are contained in `code/analysis/results/robustness_checks.R`. I similarly indicated the correspondence between the table and the text by means of notes inside the code file. 
      - All other files in the code folder are auxilary files and scripts used to create the necessary data for the graphs and tables. 


  - The Data on the basis of which these Figures and Tables were created. 
    - The Data contains several files. The most important folder, on the basis of which the results are obtained are in the folder `chapter3/data/datasets`. Below is a rough description of these files:
