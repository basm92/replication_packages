## Replication Packages for the Dissertation "The Political Elite, Self-Interest and Democratization"

### By Bas Machielsen, Utrecht University

- This repository contains three replication packages for Chapter 2, 3 and 4 of the dissertation, respectively. In each of the Chapters, an additional `README.md` file can be found, explaining in detail how to deal with reproducing tables and figures in each chapter.
	- Since the workflow of each Chapter differs slightly. 
	
- In each repository, aside from the Code used to create the Tables and Figures, there are also several auxiliary files used to shorten the Code.

- To use this, either click on the Green "Code" button (upper right), and then on "Download ZIP", or alternatively, download and install git, and fork this repository. 

- Run the `replication_packages.Rproj` file to start up the R project. 

- Then, if you want to focus on a specific chapter, run `set_working_directory.R`, which will ask for a prompt and set the working directory appropriately for any of the chapters.
	- Make sure to stay in the same R session.
